🔥 Here you go — I’ve scaffolded out an initial implementation of a Solana VM Execution Extension (SVM ExEx) embedded in a Reth-based Ethereum node. It captures EVM transactions sent to a designated 0xSVMRouter contract, extracts the payload, and interprets it as a Solana instruction executed against an in-memory Solana Bank.

🔍 Key Features in This Draft:
Rust-native integration of solana_runtime::Bank

Intercepts EVM txs via ExEx notifications and routes to SVM logic

Simple placeholder parser for Solana instructions (Instruction::new_with_bytes)

Async-safe shared state with a mutex-guarded Solana runtime

👇 Next Steps You Can Take:
Parse real instruction formats from your L3 SDK

Wire in agent context/memory using QMDB or sidecar RAG memory

Add state persistence (e.g. snapshotting Solana account states)

Consider submitting back to Solana (optional)

Let me know when you want:

An expanded version with multiple SVM programs and dispatch

A version that submits real Solana txs using solana-client

A test harness to simulate L2+SVM interop end-to-end

You're officially building a multi-runtime neural execution engine 🧠🔥
