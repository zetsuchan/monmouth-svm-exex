Hereâ€™s your initial scaffold for a Solana VM Execution Extension (SVMExEx) embedded in Reth.

This prototype does the following:

Hooks into finalized Ethereum blocks.

Checks each transaction for a special SVM prefix in calldata.

If matched, it routes the payload into a placeholder SvmExecutor module.

Outputs log messages from the simulated SVM execution.

ðŸ”® Next Steps You Can Build From Here:
Replace SvmExecutor with:

solana_runtime::Bank

Or a Wasmer-based BPF loader

Add ExEx state caching (agent memory, rollup state).

Implement dual-chain anchoring (push back to Solana or build mirrored state on Monmouth).

Integrate AI-agent control flows (e.g. auto-trigger SVM txs from EVM triggers).
